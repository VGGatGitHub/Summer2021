**Project: d-Wave optimizations for Supply Chain channels**

**Mentor:** Vesselin Gueorguiev

**Description:** d-Wave is ideal for optimization of combinatorial problems that are often faced in Supply Chain channels of various industries

**Interns:** Daniel Salazar, Isaac Méndez Barquero, Mustafa Efe Güzel, Victor Chang, Yusharth Singh, Shivani Mayekar, (Sinem Serap and Roberto Narvaez Hernandez)

## Project tasks and goals: 

In order to understand the project and its goals and tasks, the interns need to become familiar with the D-wave Leap, D-wave SDK, Strange works as a collaborative QC-platform, Google Colaboratory, and IBM QISKit.

The main goals for the program duration were:

1. Building background skills, experience, and knowledge.
2. Finding interesting optimization data sets and challenges.
3. Exploring data representations and relevant models.

The main relevant tasks were:

- Practising runs on D-wave Leap by studying and exploring various repositories: 

    **Daniel & Roberto:** Knapsak example problem formulation for D-Wave as used in [QAlpha](https://github.com/VGGatGitHub/Hackathon2020/tree/master/QAlpha);

    **Mustafa and Sinem:** Classical Anniler as used in [week4 of CDL Quantum 2020](https://github.com/VGGatGitHub/CDL-2020-Cohort-Projects/tree/master/Project_4_Ising_Annealer);

    **Victor & Isaac:** Knapsack and vehicle routing Quantum Chain [Q-Chain](https://github.com/VGGatGitHub/Quantum-Chain);

    **Yash & Shivani:** Vehicle routing exploration via QISKit and D-wave as done in [cohort #3 of QOSF](https://github.com/VGGatGitHub/QOSF-cohort3);

- Studing the [desision optimization tutorials](https://github.com/IBM/optimize-procurement-and-inventory-with-ai) from the [IBM AI Callenge 2021](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Hunger-2021#solution-ideas) and utilizing the [supply chain example data](https://github.com/IBM/optimize-procurement-and-inventory-with-ai/tree/master/tutorials/decision-optimization-tutorial/data) there.

The end-product consist of the following Jupiter notebooks:

- Exploring the IBM tools and QISKit to run decision optimization (DO) examples, see [QISKit_experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/VGGatGitHub/Summer2021/blob/main/QISKit_experiments.ipynb);

- Exploring the possibility to use the D-wave Leap to run the same decision optimization examples, see [D-Wave_experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/VGGatGitHub/Summer2021/blob/main/D-Wave_experiments.ipynb).
